NAME
    String::Trim::More - Various string trimming utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of String::Trim::More (from Perl
    distribution String-Trim-More), released on 2014-12-10.

DESCRIPTION
    This is an alternative to String::Trim (and similar modules, see "SEE
    ALSO"). Instead of a single "trim" function, this module provides
    several from which you can choose on, depending on your needs.

FUNCTIONS
  ltrim($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (including newlines) at the beginning of string.
    Equivalent to:

     $str =~ s/\A\s+//s;

  ltrim_lines($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (not including newlines) at the beginning of each line
    of string. Equivalent to:

     $str =~ s/^\s+//mg;

  rtrim($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (including newlines) at the end of string. Equivalent
    to:

     $str =~ s/[ \t]+\z//s;

  rtrim_lines($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (not including newlines) at the end of each line of
    string. Equivalent to:

     $str =~ s/[ \t]+$//mg;

  trim($str) => STR
    ltrim + rtrim.

  trim_lines($str) => STR
    ltrim_lines + rtrim_lines.

  trim_blank_lines($str) => STR
    Trim blank lines at the beginning and the end. Won't trim blank lines in
    the middle. Blank lines include lines with only whitespaces in them.

  ellipsis($str[, $maxlen, $ellipsis]) => STR
    Return $str unmodified if $str's length is less than $maxlen (default
    80). Otherwise cut $str to ($maxlen - length($ellipsis)) and append
    $ellipsis (default '...') at the end.
